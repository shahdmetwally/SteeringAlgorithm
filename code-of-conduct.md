# GROUP 5 - CODE OF CONDUCT

How do we plan to collaborate?
As this is a group project, we plan on dividing up the workload to equal parts to ensure that every member of the group contributes to the final product. We are going to have meetings within every week at set times that we decide based on everyones preferences. We will have a mix of in-person and online meetings based on team consensus. If a team member cannot attend a in-person meeting, they have the option to join via Zoom. If a person happens to be sick for a certain period of time, they are not forced to work for that time period.
How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
We will communicate during our meetings and on Discord channels we have created about the current tasks at hand and how we are going to divide them, as well as future tasks that we need to plan ahead of time. We will use Trello as a way of organizing tasks. On Trello, we will assign tasks to the team members based on their preferences and what was discussed during our meetings. With Trello, we will also be tracking tasks and milestone coverage.
How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
We will have weekly meetings every Monday morning to ensure there is a consensus within the team about the project development. Additionally, as mentioned before we have a Discord server where we will communicate any issues or progress we have within the project tasks.
What is our usual communication plan?
We will be having a mix of in-person and online meetings based on team agreement. For the online meetings we will be using Zoom. The meeting schedule will be as described below:


Weekly meetings on Monday: to ensure consensus about the project development. Additionally, if team member(s) are done with their tasks they can be assigned to new tasks.


Weekly meetings on Thursday: updates on task development.


How will we solve conflicts?
We will encourge healthy conflict to create development. As a team, we understand that there will be differences/disagreements within the group therefore communication is key to resolving conflict within our team. As a result we decided that if there is disagreement on how to move forward with the project development, the majority vote will dictate the outcome.
what are your ideas/measures to prevent conflicts from occurring in first place as your conflict section is very short?
Digital Tools

Discord: will be used for general communication within the group such as discussing bugs or issues within the project development.
Trello: will be used strictly for task management.
